                                In graph theory, the shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.
                                The problem of finding the shortest path between two intersections on a road map may be modeled as a special case of the shortest path problem in graphs, where the vertices correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to road segments, each weighted by the length of the segment.

                                The shortest path problem can be defined for graphs whether undirected, directed, or mixed. It is defined here for undirected graphs; for directed graphs the definition of path requires that consecutive vertices be connected by an appropriate directed edge.</p>

                                The problem is also sometimes called the single-pair shortest path problem, to distinguish it from the following variations:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        The single-source shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest paths from a source vertex v to all other vertices in the graph.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The single-destination shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest paths from all vertices in the directed graph to a single destination vertex v. This can be reduced to the single-source shortest path problem by reversing the arcs in the directed graph.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The all-pairs shortest path problem, in which we have to find shortest paths between every pair of vertices v, v' in the graph.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
